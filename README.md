##Introduction
Alpha Team created a pet adoption web application (built using a Django backend and React frontend) that allows users to search for pets based on their type, breed, disposition, etc. Shelters are able to post profiles of their pets to the application which are then searchable by the users. Information such as age, weight, disposition, gender, a bio, and availability status are included in the pet’s profiles. The application aims to match users to the ideal pets available from the shelters.

##A User’s Perspective
Users consist of shelters that are putting pets up for adoption and people interested in adopting pets. From the perspective of the shelter, the application provides a place to advertise available pets and connect them to fitting homes. Shelters are able to create pets, update their information, and remove pets. From the perspective of the adopters, the application provides a space where they can find information about a wide variety of potential pets to adopt. The adopters are able to search for pets by the characteristics they value most (breed, disposition, etc.) Using the application allows both types of users exposure to a wide variety of options with regards to finding a great match for the home and the pet.
